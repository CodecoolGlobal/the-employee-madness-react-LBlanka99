# Journey Tasks Branch
This is one of the branches of my employee management system project. Employee Madness has several branches, and each of them has some different features, but the basics of the applictaion is the same everywhere.

## Features in this branch
On this branch I developed the following features:
<ul>
  <li>The list of the employees are filterable by their Position and Level.</li>
  <li>The list of the employees are arrangeable by their First name, Last name, Middle name, Position and Level.</li>
  <li>There is also an equipment entity which is editable from the client side.</li>
  <li>There is a checkbox next to every employee indicating whether the given employee is present.</li>
  <li>There is pagination at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>
